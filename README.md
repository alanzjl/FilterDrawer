# 2'' Filter Drawer for astrophotography

Designed by JZ, https://alanz.info/

This is a filter drawer that houses a single 2'' filter that you may want to use between your telescope and your camera.
I've added both a Nikon-F mount adapter and a Canon-EF mount adapter.
Both adapters are designed to give the DSLR a standard 55mm flange-to-sensor distance.

One side of the drawer connects to the camera, the otherside accepts 2'' barrel and locks with thumbscrews.

## Recommended print settings

Try to print with higher wall thickness and infill to increase structure rigidity. I use 3 wall line counts and 90% infill.
I don't think 90% is really necessary, but I did this mainly to block external lights.
You may also want to consider painting the inside for better light blocking.

I use 0.1mm layer height for the filter holder and 0.2mm for the drawer body.
The filter holder has M48 0.75 threads on it, so smaller layer height will help.

I think all rigid common filament should work (PLA, ABS, etc), by "rigid" I mean not flexibile, e.g. TPU. I printed mine with carbon fiber reinforced polycarbonate, which wasn't really necessary but I happened to have some laying around.

There is indeed one part called "TPU_locker" that you may want to print with TPU. 
It isn't really necessary, but good to have if you have TPU filament.

## Hardware

1. M3x8 screw x 4
2. M3 thumbscrew x 3 (or just use M3x8)
3. M3 nuts x7

## Other advice

Don't over screw the filter since the thread is 3d printed!
